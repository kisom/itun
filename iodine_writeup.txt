Setting Up An Iodine Tunnel in OpenBSD
kisom <kisom@devio.us>

What is iodine?
---------------
Iodine is a DNS tunneling application; it is useful for situations where
DNS requests are allowed but certain regular TCP sessions are not. It is
important to note that the tunnel is unencrypted; therefore, it should be
supplemented with an SSH tunnel for security.


Overview
---------------------
This guide will cover the following:
    * requirements
    * intro to iodine
    * server setup
    * client setup

I have written some scripts to largely automate the process, and these
will be presented as well.
