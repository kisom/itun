Setting Up An Iodine Tunnel in OpenBSD
kisom <kisom@devio.us>

What is iodine?
---------------
Iodine is a DNS tunneling application; it is useful for situations where
DNS requests are allowed but certain regular TCP sessions are not. It is
important to note that the tunnel is unencrypted; therefore, it should be
supplemented with an SSH tunnel for security.


Overview
--------
This guide will cover the following:
    * requirements
    * intro to iodine
    * server setup
    * client setup

I have written some scripts to largely automate the process, and these
will be presented as well.


Requirements
------------
iodine requires a domain that you have control over, the latest source tarballs
from http://code.kryo.se/iodine/ (both client and server should have the same
version), a BSD or Linux client, and a server with a static IP (or dynamic DNS)
that runs Linux or BSD. If you plan on using the scripts I wrote, you will need
the perl module Term::ReadKey - it's a common module that you can either
install with cpan (sudo cpan Term::ReadKey), or use one of these packages:
	* OpenBSD: devel/p5-Term-ReadKey
	* Debian: libterm-readkey-perl
